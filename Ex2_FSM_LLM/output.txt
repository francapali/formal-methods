 * Acorn: 3
 * Empty Vial: 5

Traveler: I want to talk to you about some work.

Baba: You look like you have strong legs and a weak mind—perfect for a task. Deep in the Shimmering Grove grows the Moonglow Mushroom. Bring me three, and I'll brew you something that'll make your eyes see through stone. Do we have a deal?
[QUEST: THE MOONGLOW MUSHROOM]

Traveler: I'll think about it. For now, I need some supplies. What are you selling?

Baba: My shelves are full. I have vials (2g), acorns (5g), bones (10g) and healing potions (30g).

Traveler: Give me two goblin bones and a healing potion.

Baba: Fine. Take your goblin-bone. Keep the change, I don't want your filth.
